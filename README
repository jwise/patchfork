1. Installation
	see doc/INSTALL

2. Requirements
    * PHP 5.1.3 or newer
    * PHP-Pear
    * DOM2 capable browser (firefox, konqueror, opera, safari, etc)
    * MPD 0.12.0 or later 


3. Shortcuts
	Key shortcuts in browsers are a mess, some don't send on certain keys and others
	don't allow you to cancel default action, therefore the shortcuts are a little weird.
	I've tried to use what seems most logical and works in most browsers, that also means
	there's a slight workaround some places

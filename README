Patchfork is a fork of the excellent Pitchfork MPD client.  The original
author, Roger Bystr√∏m ("remiss"), appears to have fallen off the face of the
Internet, and along with him, the Pitchfork web site.  Patchfork, then, is
my bug fix (and maybe feature?) branch.  It is also a lot more Googlable of
a name than Pitchfork.  The fork started when I needed to update it because
of a format change in the MPD 0.15.0 (?) `status` query response.

You can find the old Pitchfork site on archive.org:

This is not an official release of Pitchfork.  This patched version is not
supported by the original maintainers (and is not supported in any official
capacity by me).

3. Shortcuts
	Key shortcuts in browsers are a mess, some don't send on certain keys and others
	don't allow you to cancel default action, therefore the shortcuts are a little weird.
	I've tried to use what seems most logical and works in most browsers, that also means
	there's a slight workaround some places
